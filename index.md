# Eric Chen's CSE 110 Info Page
## **About me**
My name is TEST Eric and I am second-year Data Science major. Even though my major does not require CSE 110, I want to take this class to gain experience working with a team on a large (at least large for me) project. 
## **My Experience**
I am not a complete beginner to Software Engineering, but I do not think I have directly *done* Software Engineering (although my understanding of Software Engineering will probably change after this). Since I am Data Science major, I have been so used to importing packages like
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```
I have done analyses on different datasets using these. However, I do not know much about web development and using different scripting languages, which I am excited to learn about this quarter!
## **Interests**
##### ***Food***

I have always been a foodie my whole life. Although I do not eat a lot, I know quite a lot about food, especially food from East Asia since that is where my family is from. The image I put above is a picture of Dim Sum, which is something I grew up eating quite often since my family comes from the Canton region of China. \
A few of my favorite foods are: 
- Hot Pot
- Instant Noodles
- Sundubu-jjigae
##### ***K-Pop***

Unlike food, K-Pop is something I got into relatively recently in 2020. I will admit BTS' "Dynamite" was what brought me into K-Pop. They are still my favorite K-Pop group, but my current top 3 are:
1. BTS
2. ENHYPEN
3. Seventeen
However, I am more of a song person than a specific group's *stan*, meaning that I mostly listen to the songs that I like from different groups rather than listen to the entire discography of one group. My playlist might first start off with ASTRO and then the lyrics
> "Blackpink in your area!"

come out of nowhere. The playlists I listened to a lot this summer were [Summer 2022 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdCp2i7_0Cc) and [Relaxing Kpop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E0bOI-ecXY).
